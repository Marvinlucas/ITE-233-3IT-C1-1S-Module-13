<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1 title = "wow" onclick="this.innerHTML='Ooopsssss!'">Click on this text!</h1>
</br>
<bold style = "color:blue" onclick = "this.innerHTML = 'hello world'">click this </bold>
</body>
</html>
So, what is the meaning of this, that is the property that pointing to itself within the elements to display the content. (file->sas13.Exec1.html)
In this example, a function is called from the event handler:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1 onclick="changeText(this)">Click on this text!</h1>
<script>
function changeText(id) {
id.innerHTML = "Ooops!";
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
